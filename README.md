## Introduction

Our project is to use temperature and light intensity sensors to monitor and control the environmental factors in a greenhouse to make sure that they are in an appropriate range so the plants can grow fast with little human work.

## Motivation

The greenhouse is one of the most important innovations to improve crop yield. Temperature and light intensity are two important environmental factors that affect the plants’ growth. But it is hard and time-consuming for people to monitor and control these factors manually, which is the motivation behind this Smart Greenhouse project.
