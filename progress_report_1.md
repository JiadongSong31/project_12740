## Problems:
* How to control the change of temperature and show its change
* How to control the change of light and show its change
* Do not have any heating devices

## Solution:
* Use PID to maintain temperature float between a small range
* Use light bulbs (LED) to show change of light
* Use heating light bulb or hair dryer as heating devices

## Others:
* Do not need to make sure the sampling frequency is at more than twice the desired
frequency to be measured, since the frequency of temperature data is low.
